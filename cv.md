For the last 2 years I have been working at the  "Integral" plant, where I was sent to work out after completing the budget full-time training at the Academy of Communications, specializing in Software Testing.

During these two years, I took UX / UI design courses, and also studied at the Skyeng online school of English in technical English.

At the moment I am studying at the correspondence department of the IIT BSUIR, specializing in programmable mobile systems. At the moment, the third course. Graduation is planned for January 2022.
